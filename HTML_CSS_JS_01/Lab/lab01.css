/*
About: fallback
The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. 
Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma.
